**University of Alabama at Birmingham | Department of Genetics**

## About

The Ma Lab investigates the fundamental mechanisms of immune surveillance in cancer, focusing on how DNA damage responses and epigenetic dysregulation influence immunotherapy outcomes. Led by Dr. Xiaoxiao Ma, our research aims to develop next-generation cancer treatments through mechanistic insights into tumor immunity.

## Research Focus

🧬 **DNA Damage, epigenetic dysregulation & Tumor immunology** - How mutagenesis and repair defects and epigenetic disruption impact immune recognition and drive immunotherapy resistance
🎯 **Cancer Vaccine and TCR-therapy development** - Advanced pipelines for TCR identification and immunogenicity prediction  
⚗️ **Synthetic biology approach to improve antigen presentation** - Expand the targetability of non-canonical antigens

## Key Publications

- **Nature Genetics** (2022): POLE/POLD1 mutations in checkpoint blockade immunity
- **Nature Cancer** (2020): BRCA mutations and immunotherapy response
- **Trends in Cancer** (2022): Understanding what makes immunotherapies work

## Opportunities

We welcome **rotation students** and **postdoctoral fellows** interested in:
- Cancer immunotherapy mechanisms
- Computational immunogenomics
- DNA damage repair pathways
- Translational tumor immunology research
